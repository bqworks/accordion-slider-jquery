# Update #

Updates will be announced on the [bqworks](https://twitter.com/bqworks) Twitter channel, so I recommend following in order to be up to date with the latest releases. Also, updates will be announced in the Changelog section of the accordion's CodeCanyon page.

When a new version is available, you can download it for free from your CodeCanyon account: [http://codecanyon.net/downloads/](http://codecanyon.net/downloads/).

## Changelog ##

**v. 2.0**

* changed the plugin name from 'Classic Accordion' to 'Accordion Slider'
* rewritten the entire code and implemented modular architecture
* added many new features

_Note:_ As of version 2.0, the name of the plugin was changed from 'Classic Accordion' to 'Accordion Slider'. The plugin was completely revamped, so the name was changed in order to be more representative for the functionality that the plugin provides now. Also, because the changes are significant, it is not backwards compatible with versions older than 2.0.
